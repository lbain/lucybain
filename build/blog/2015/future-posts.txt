Who are your female role models?
I don't "do" role models as much as "people I think are awesome". Role models feel far away (I'm probably never going to have a meaningful chat with Sheryl Sandberg), but I've met a lot of awesome people.
- My mom, she's taught me a lot about compassion
- Megan Cook (another one of the video members), she's generally kick ass and has tought me about standing up for myself
- My aunt, she took on a whole new career and taught me about pursing joy in life
- Angie, she decided to learn programming, did a three month bootcamp and got a job. She taught me about determination, hard work, and focus.
The list goes on, some are women in Atlassian, some aren't. Some are people I see everyday and others I haven't seen for years. Every one of them has impacted my life and challenged how I view things. I'm grateful to have such amazing women in my life.
