    <p>We started with a light breakfast and moved right into the talks. Again, so many positive vibes and happy voices. Everyone is clearly excited to be here!</p>

<p>We started off with some stories from the organisers about how they got into tech and why they decided to work with Ela Conf. It&#39;s always nice to hear people’s stories and better understand where the conference comes from.</p>

<h3>Five things I Leared About Leadership from my Son, by <a href="https://twitter.com/rockchick322004">Mary Scotton</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>Get your hands dirty - be completely involved in, and committed to, your work. Other people will notice that you’re willing to get shit done.</li>
<li>Break the rules - a.k.a. don’t do what your told. Your job isn’t just to do what you’re told, it’s to think, make considered decisions, and build good stuff.</li>
<li>Go to coffee - spending authentic time with people (in and out of work) builds community and your network. Make an effort to keep moving relationships forward.</li>
<li>Respect other perspectives - as a leader, it’s your job to make work a safe place to share different ideas. This is related to gender/race/etc. diversity, but it’s more about diversity of thought and allowing others to open up.</li>
<li>Be you - if you’re holding yourself back you’re not able to fully do the above and connect with people.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Never Accept the First Offer, by <a href="https://twitter.com/WhataTiberius">Tiberius Hefflin</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Pay gap between women and men still exists. Companies can help by doing pay auditing (Atlassian does this - yay!), having blind applications, and setting up rules to favour people asking for more information around pay.</li>
<li>Start small on things you don’t care about so you can get used to the process.</li>
<li>Do your research before you start negotiating - what really is a <em>fair</em> offer.</li>
<li>Make a list of your skills are and what you bring to the table. This can help keep you focused and remind you why you’re asking for what you’re asking for.</li>
<li>Ask for a pay review in six months so you have time to show them what you’re worth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Respect Effect, by <a href="https://twitter.com/TimirahJ">Timirah James</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>You need to teach people how to treat you, and what you will and won’t put up with. Make it clear when you don’t feel respected.</li>
<li>Treat yourself the way you want others to treat you - this effect works from the inside out.</li>
<li>The way that you’re perceived is something you can change, but you have to be mindful of it all the time - this takes effort!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get yourself a squad!, by <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolelzhu">Nicole Zhu</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>“Coding is not a skill that you just innately have.”</li>
<li><em>Staying</em> in tech is much harder than starting</li>
<li>A squad is there to support you and your work - they’re friends who have the context of your work experience</li>
<li>Your friends can give you more authentic feedback and keep you energized</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/blog/ela-conf/squad-6da74156.jpg" alt="Mulan’s Squad" /></p>

<h3>Leadership and management (panel)</h3>

<ul>
<li>It’s all about communication - listening to your team members and getting them to open up about difficulties they’re experiencing, give time for others to offer suggestions before jumping in.</li>
<li>1:1s should be more than just status checks; ask about life and future roles.</li>
<li>If you’re wondering about moving to leadership, think about your current job: what kinds parts do you enjoy the most? (Coding vs. working with people vs. strategy meetings)</li>
<li>Script difficult conversations (and practice with easy conversations!) so you know what you’re going to say and can stay calm</li>
<li>Rotating roles (like scrum master) so others in the team can know what’s involved</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Value of “I Don’t Know”, by <a href="https://twitter.com/not_pele">Elise Wei</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Saying “I don’t know” helps fight imposter syndrome and makes others more comfortable with being honest about what they know too.</li>
<li>Don’t just ask for the answer, ask <em>how</em> they found the answer</li>
<li>Builds up a culture of learning - you can encourage others to admit when they don’t know something and all learn together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>It’s not you, it’s them. What next?, by <a href="https://twitter.com/theOnlyRuthie">Ruthie Floats</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>It’s all about feelings. Your salary doesn’t actually matter, it’s how you feel about your salary that really matters.</li>
<li>Determine the feeling, then the cause, then come up with an action. “I feel (blank) because (blank). So I will (blank).”</li>
<li>What feelings are you hoping to get out of working in open source? Look for open source projects that meet these needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Involved and Giving Back As A Beginner, by <a href="https://twitter.com/_lisli">Lisa Yoder</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Document what you know, what you’re learning, and what you’re struggling with</li>
<li>Keep lists of things you did that were hard - refer to these when you need a boost (like my moments of win list!)</li>
<li>Noobs often explain things better since they just recently learned it. “You can be an expert at being a beginner.”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Take up space: claiming your place in tech, by <a href="https://twitter.com/adriennefriend">Adrienne Lowe</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Show yourself the same compassion you would show others (kinda a reverse golden rule)</li>
<li>Celebrate the little wins too since they’re practice for celebrating the big wins; these wins help fight imposter syndrome</li>
<li>“Asking for help when you need it is standing up for yourself.”</li>
<li>There’s a difference between <em>real life</em> struggle (food, safety, belonging, opening up to others), and <em>learning</em> struggle. Take a deep breath and understand the difference.</li>
<li>Reference to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L0F01NK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">We should all be feminists</a></li>
</ul>
