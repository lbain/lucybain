        For the next 12-14 months I'd like to learn front end dev.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been doing Rails for a little over 2 years now, and almost all of my training and experience has been heavily back end oriented. Pretty much everything I learned at uni was for back end languages and processes. I took all the web courses that were offered, but they didn't focus heavily on JS or CSS - although they did expose me to those concepts. Certainly everything I've done since uni has been back end (just a bit of Python...</p>

        It's been almost 3 weeks since RubyConf. Feels like longer. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2014/RubyConfAU/">quick review</a> after the event, but that post didn't do RubyConf justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, I'm not sure what made RubyConf so great. The talks? Meeting new people? Chatting with existing friends? Learning? Seeing so many people interested in the same thing? I don't know. Everything there was pretty amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for me, the most amazing part was what happened when I left. When I went back to work. When the talks were over, and...</p>

      <p>
        I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!
      </p>
      <p>
        In Sublime, under <code>Preference</code> select <code>Key Bindings - User</code>. If you've got anything in there already, just add the <code>{ "keys"... }</code> section below. Otherwise you can replace the <code>[]</code> with:
      </p>
      <pre class="highlight plaintext">[
        { "keys": ["super+i"],
          "command": "reindent"}
      ]</pre>
      <p>
        Now you can use <code>cmd + i</code> (mac), or <code>ctrl + i</code> (windows...</p>

        A friend of mine recently got set up with Twitter and asked for some pointers. Another friend complemented me on my feed. I felt flattered, and wanted to make how I use Twitter public.

      <p>
        There are <em>many</em> sites out there to help you use Twitter more effectively. I do not believe what I have to say is better or more relevant, this is just written from one friend to another, I hope you find it helpful.

        I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns out I needn't have worried. The Ruby community was just as amazing as ever.

        I met a bunch of new people - many women programmers, and many people hoping to make programming more available through mentorship and code education. While I enjoyed meeting...</p>

        I've shared the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Jj8I4CVRe8k2sP8m17PMk0PXwbY0646MxWDS6VJ5yo/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> used for keeping track of time, so you can see the schedule we actually used on the day. We had <a href="http://lbain.github.io/rails-girls-next/">three exercises</a> for the girls to work through - test driven development (TDD), focused work with Ruby, and learning how the web works with Sinatra.

      <p>
        I often forget which branch I'm on. Sure, I have <code>git branch</code> aliased (it's probably one of my most frequently used commands) but sometimes I <em>know</em> I'm on another branch. A few commits and merges later I find out I was wrong, and it's time for some branch cleaning.

        <code>::ActiveModel::Validations</code> treats <code>validates</code> and <code>validate</code> differently. <code>validates</code> is used for normal validations <code>presence</code>, <code>length</code>, and the like. <code>validate</code> is used for custom validation methods <code>validate_name_starts_with_a</code>, or whatever crazy method you come up with. These methods are clearly useful and help keep data clean.

      <p>
        I said at the beginning that I wasn't a huge fan of TDD. It just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Today I took some time to explore that, and it turns out, I'm not the only one. Most people have mixed reviews, and that's exactly what I'm experiencing now.

          <a href="http://www.writemoretests.com/2011/09/test-driven-development-give-me-break.html">Test-Driven Development? Give me a break…</a> said that <b>requiring</b> TDD was a bad idea, but that the general principal is probably good. It's possible to have too much of a good thing.
