        I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns out I needn't have worried. The Ruby community was just as amazing as ever.

        I met a bunch of new people - many women programmers, and many people hoping to make programming more available through mentorship and code education. While I enjoyed meeting...</p>

        Wahoo! Rails Girls Next happened without a (major) hitch today! I am so happy with how it went, and to have helped with these girls' continuing Ruby education.

        I've shared the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19Jj8I4CVRe8k2sP8m17PMk0PXwbY0646MxWDS6VJ5yo/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> used for keeping track of time, so you can see the schedule we actually used on the day. We had <a href="http://lbain.github.io/rails-girls-next/">three exercises</a> for the girls to work through - test driven development (TDD), focused work with Ruby, and learning how the web works with Sinatra.

        I often forget which branch I'm on. Sure, I have <code>git branch</code> aliased (it's probably one of my most frequently used commands) but sometimes I <em>know</em> I'm on another branch. A few commits and merges later I find out I was wrong, and it's time for some branch cleaning.

        Recently my coworker <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SimonHildebrandt/">Simon</a> gave me the following code:
