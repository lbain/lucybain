        For the next 12-14 months I'd like to learn front end dev.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been doing Rails for a little over 2 years now, and almost all of my training and experience has been heavily back end oriented. Pretty much everything I learned at uni was for back end languages and processes. I took all the web courses that were offered, but they didn't focus heavily on JS or CSS - although they did expose me to those concepts. Certainly everything I've done since uni has been back end (just a bit of Python...</p>

        It's been almost 3 weeks since RubyConf. Feels like longer. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2014/RubyConfAU/">quick review</a> after the event, but that post didn't do RubyConf justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, I'm not sure what made RubyConf so great. The talks? Meeting new people? Chatting with existing friends? Learning? Seeing so many people interested in the same thing? I don't know. Everything there was pretty amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for me, the most amazing part was what happened when I left. When I went back to work. When the talks were over, and...</p>

      <p>
        I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!
      </p>
      <p>
        In Sublime, under <code>Preference</code> select <code>Key Bindings - User</code>. If you've got anything in there already, just add the <code>{ "keys"... }</code> section below. Otherwise you can replace the <code>[]</code> with:
      </p>
      <pre class="highlight plaintext">[
        { "keys": ["super+i"],
          "command": "reindent"}
      ]</pre>
      <p>
        Now you can use <code>cmd + i</code> (mac), or <code>ctrl + i</code> (windows...</p>

        A friend of mine recently got set up with Twitter and asked for some pointers. Another friend complemented me on my feed. I felt flattered, and wanted to make how I use Twitter public.

      <p>
        There are <em>many</em> sites out there to help you use Twitter more effectively. I do not believe what I have to say is better or more relevant, this is just written from one friend to another, I hope you find it helpful.

        I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns out I needn't have worried. The Ruby community was just as amazing as ever.

        I met a bunch of new people - many women programmers, and many people hoping to make programming more available through mentorship and code education. While I enjoyed meeting...</p>

We had <a href="http://lbain.github.io/rails-girls-next/">three exercises</a> for the girls to work through - test driven development (TDD), focused work with Ruby, and learning how the web works with Sinatra.

        I often forget which branch I'm on. Sure, I have <code>git branch</code> aliased (it's probably one of my most frequently used commands) but sometimes I <em>know</em> I'm on another branch. A few commits and merges later I find out I was wrong, and it's time for some branch cleaning.

        I've wanted to run a programming study group for quite a while. Although I love what <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/">InstallFest</a> do, I think attendees find it quite hard to continue learning. They have some support from the community through initiatives like DevHub to continue working on projects and learning about Ruby and Rails. But there isn't a clear path for them to go down - <a href="http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/6-best-learning-ruby-books">books?</a> which ones? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732119/ruby-video-tutorials">videos?</a> by whom? <a href="https://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/ruby">personal project?</a> what kind?

        I use Sublime. I know, I know, I'm not a <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">"real"</a> dev. Whatever. It works for me. One of my favourite features is the multi-cursor.

        I stumbled across this validation gotcha a while back, but that was before I had this awesome blog ;) I think this is a pretty big one, hope this help someone!

        <code>::ActiveModel::Validations</code> treats <code>validates</code> and <code>validate</code> differently. <code>validates</code> is used for normal validations <code>presence</code>, <code>length</code>, and the like. <code>validate</code> is used for custom validation methods <code>validate_name_starts_with_a</code>, or whatever crazy method you come up with. These methods are clearly useful and help keep data clean.
