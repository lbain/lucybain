      <p><em>What does "IIFE" even stand for?</em></p>
      
      <p>IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</p>
      
      <p><em>Great, so what are IIFEs?</em></p>
      
      <p>An IIFE is an anonymous function that is created and then immediately invoked. It's not called from anywhere else (hence why it's anonymous), but runs just after being created.</p>
      
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre class="highlight plaintext">(function () {&#x000A;  return 5;&#x000A;} ());&#x000A;// returns 5 right away</pre>
      <p>They can be used to guard against <strong>unintended effects of hoisting...</strong></p>

      <h2>Explain how prototypal inheritance works</h2>
      
      <p>JS objects each have a "hook" to it's parent object, or prototype. Obviously everything the child object defines it has access to, but it also can climb up the prototype tree to access it's parent's (or ancesstor's) methods and properties.</p>
      
      <p><strong>(the obligatory animal) Example:</strong></p>
      <pre class="highlight plaintext">function Animal(){&#x000A;  this.alive = true;&#x000A;}&#x000A;&#x000A;function Mammal() {&#x000A;  this.warmBlooded = true;&#x000A;  this.hasTail = false;&#x000A;  this.move = function(){&#x000A;    if(this.hasTail){&#x000A;      return "Moving...</pre>

      <p><strong><code>this</code> is the context the code is running in</strong></p>
      
      <p>However, the context seems to change a lot, and I find it rather confusing. So I signed upf for an <a href="http://derickbailey.com/email-courses/masteringthis/">email series</a> on how <code>this</code> can change. Here's a sweeping overview of that series:</p>

        I'm continuing my JS learning and found a list of <a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">front end interview questions</a>. There's a section devoted to JS on there for me to work through. If they're important enough to know in an interview I should probably know about them too.

      <h2>Explain event delegation</h2>
      <p>
        Well I'm glad you asked. As it turns out we covered this topic in my <a href="http://codesydney.com">JS study group</a> when I wrote my <a href="code-sydney-work/tic-tac-toe/">Tic Tac Toe game.</a>

        My coworker users vim, and has a snazzy macro to put a <code>binding.pry</code> wherever he using a keyboad shortcut. I thought it was a neat trick (and he mentioned something about Sublime not being a real editor), so I decided to implement it for Sublime as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked up <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/macros.html">how to make macros</a> and wrote one for adding <code>binding.pry</code>. Basically you need to use <code>control + q</code> to start and stop your macro recording. Then you save the macro by going to <code>Tools/Save Macro...</code>. You should name it something memerable...</p>

        I've been doing Rails for a little over 2 years now, and almost all of my training and experience has been heavily back end oriented. Pretty much everything I learned at uni was for back end languages and processes. I took all the web courses that were offered, but they didn't focus heavily on JS or CSS - although they did expose me to those concepts. Certainly everything I've done since uni has been back end (just a bit of Python...</p>

        It's been almost 3 weeks since RubyConf. Feels like longer. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2014/RubyConfAU/">quick review</a> after the event, but that post didn't do RubyConf justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, I'm not sure what made RubyConf so great. The talks? Meeting new people? Chatting with existing friends? Learning? Seeing so many people interested in the same thing? I don't know. Everything there was pretty amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for me, the most amazing part was what happened when I left. When I went back to work. When the talks were over, and...</p>

        I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!
      </p>
      <p>
        In Sublime, under <code>Preference</code> select <code>Key Bindings - User</code>. If you've got anything in there already, just add the <code>{ "keys"... }</code> section below. Otherwise you can replace the <code>[]</code> with:
      </p>
      <pre class="highlight plaintext">[&#x000A;  { "keys": ["super+i"],&#x000A;    "command": "reindent"}&#x000A;]</pre>
      <p>
        Now you can use <code>cmd + i</code> (mac), or <code>ctrl + i</code> (windows...</p>

        There are <em>many</em> sites out there to help you use Twitter more effectively. I do not believe what I have to say is better or more relevant, this is just written from one friend to another, I hope you find it helpful.

        I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns out I needn't have worried. The Ruby community was just as amazing as ever.

        I met a bunch of new people - many women programmers, and many people hoping to make programming more available through mentorship and code education. While I enjoyed meeting...</p>
