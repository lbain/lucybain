          I stumbled across this validation gotcha a while back, but that was before I had this awesome blog ;) I think this is a pretty big one, hope this help someone!

          I said at the beginning that I wasn't a huge fan of TDD. It just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Today I took some time to explore that, and it turns out, I'm not the only one. Most people have mixed reviews, and that...</p>

          I'm continuing on at Coders Dojo, today I worked on <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/roman-numerals/">Roman Numerals</a>. I've heard this problem talked about, but haven't actually worked on it myself. It was harder than I expected (and involved a lot of Googling for the correct...</p>

          I started the next <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/prime-factors/">kata</a> at Coders Dojo. I think you're supposed to do katas over and over again, but I didn't think I'd gain that much from repeating the FizzBuzz kata from yesterday. Maybe when I've got a better hang of things I can go back to...</p>

          Second day of working with TDD and I actually got to write some <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-2">code!</a> I tried to work with <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/">Coders Dojo,</a> but their web interface only seems to allow Unit Test (we use RSpec at work, so that's what I'd like to start with)...</p>

          I've been feeling for a while now that I'd like to be a better programmer. Right now I can make stuff happen, but I usually don't think it's particularly well designed. Since it's a new year, full of possibilities, I thought I'd spend...</p>
