          I'm continuing my JS learning and found a list of <a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">front end interview questions</a>. There's a section devoted to JS on there for me to work through. If they're important enough to know in an interview I should probably know about them too.

        <p>
          My coworker users vim, and has a snazzy macro to put a <code>binding.pry</code> wherever he using a keyboad shortcut. I thought it was a neat trick (and he mentioned something about Sublime not being a real editor), so I decided to implement it for Sublime as...</p>

          For the next 12-14 months I'd like to learn front end dev.

          I've been doing Rails for a little over 2 years now, and almost all of my training and experience has been heavily back end oriented. Pretty much everything I learned at uni was for...</p>

        <p>
          It's been almost 3 weeks since RubyConf. Feels like longer. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2014/RubyConfAU/">quick review</a> after the event, but that post didn't do RubyConf justice.

          Really, I'm not sure what made RubyConf so great. The talks? Meeting new people? Chatting with existing...</p>

          I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!

          A friend of mine recently got set up with Twitter and asked for some pointers. Another friend complemented me on my feed. I felt flattered, and wanted to make how I use Twitter public.

        <p>
          I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns...</p>

          I've wanted to run a programming study group for quite a while. Although I love what <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/">InstallFest</a> do, I think attendees find it quite hard to continue learning.

          I often forget which branch I'm on. Sure, I have <code>git branch</code> aliased (it's probably one of my most frequently used commands) but sometimes I <em>know</em> I'm on another branch. A few commits and merges later I find out I was wrong, and it's time for some...</p>
