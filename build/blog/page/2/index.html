We had <a href="http://lbain.github.io/rails-girls-next/">three exercises</a> for the girls to work through - test driven development (TDD), focused work with Ruby, and learning how the web works with Sinatra.

        I've wanted to run a programming study group for quite a while. Although I love what <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/">InstallFest</a> do, I think attendees find it quite hard to continue learning. They have some support from the community through initiatives like DevHub to continue working on projects and learning about Ruby and Rails. But there isn't a clear path for them to go down - <a href="http://blog.mediumequalsmessage.com/6-best-learning-ruby-books">books?</a> which ones? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5732119/ruby-video-tutorials">videos?</a> by whom? <a href="https://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/ruby">personal project?</a> what kind?

        I often forget which branch I'm on. Sure, I have <code>git branch</code> aliased (it's probably one of my most frequently used commands) but sometimes I <em>know</em> I'm on another branch. A few commits and merges later I find out I was wrong, and it's time for some branch cleaning.

        I use Sublime. I know, I know, I'm not a <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">"real"</a> dev. Whatever. It works for me. One of my favourite features is the multi-cursor.

        I stumbled across this validation gotcha a while back, but that was before I had this awesome blog ;) I think this is a pretty big one, hope this help someone!

        <code>::ActiveModel::Validations</code> treats <code>validates</code> and <code>validate</code> differently. <code>validates</code> is used for normal validations <code>presence</code>, <code>length</code>, and the like. <code>validate</code> is used for custom validation methods <code>validate_name_starts_with_a</code>, or whatever crazy method you come up with. These methods are clearly useful and help keep data clean.

        I said at the beginning that I wasn't a huge fan of TDD. It just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Today I took some time to explore that, and it turns out, I'm not the only one. Most people have mixed reviews, and that's exactly what I'm experiencing now.

      <p>
        I'm continuing on at Coders Dojo, today I worked on <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/roman-numerals/">Roman Numerals</a>. I've heard this problem talked about, but haven't actually worked on it myself. It was harder than I expected (and involved a lot of Googling for the correct way to convert numbers to roman numerals), but I did <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-4">finish</a> it with all green specs.

        Back in December Elle suggested running a continuation event for Rails Girls, something for the girls who had completed <a href="http://www.railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> and were looking for something else to push their Ruby/Rails education a bit further. I thought this was a great idea and wanted to be part of it. Elle suggested I organise it and make it happen (with a bunch of support from her and RubyConf), and I was really keen for the challenge and having a bigger role in the Ruby community. I'd talked with Elle and others...</p>

        I started the next <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/prime-factors/">kata</a> at Coders Dojo. I think you're supposed to do katas over and over again, but I didn't think I'd gain that much from repeating the FizzBuzz kata from yesterday. Maybe when I've got a better hang of things I can go back to FizzBuzz and learn something from it. Anyways, today's exercise was new to me - finding all the prime factors for a given number. Of course I've done this in math class, but I haven't written a program for it before.

        Second day of working with TDD and I actually got to write some <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-2">code!</a> I tried to work with <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/">Coders Dojo,</a> but their web interface only seems to allow Unit Test (we use RSpec at work, so that's what I'd like to start with), and I couldn't correct yesterday's command line tool/xcode issue (hopefully I'll be able to download xcode properly when I get to work on Monday). Anyways, I used their site to get some ideas of what to work on and decided on the classic FizzBuzz. An...</p>
