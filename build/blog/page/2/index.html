      <p>
        I said at the beginning that I wasn't a huge fan of TDD. It just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Today I took some time to explore that, and it turns out, I'm not the only one. Most people have mixed reviews, and that's exactly what I'm experiencing now.

          <a href="http://www.writemoretests.com/2011/09/test-driven-development-give-me-break.html">Test-Driven Development? Give me a breakâ€¦</a> said that <b>requiring</b> TDD was a bad idea, but that the general principal is probably good. It's possible to have too much of a good thing.

        I'm continuing on at Coders Dojo, today I worked on <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/roman-numerals/">Roman Numerals</a>. I've heard this problem talked about, but haven't actually worked on it myself. It was harder than I expected (and involved a lot of Googling for the correct way to convert numbers to roman numerals), but I did <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-4">finish</a> it with all green specs.

        I also watch the next <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBybIZJpyA&amp;amp;list=PLVBFw0Pn9e9IduDzgOx7Yoh0ur7SZa7hu&amp;amp;index=3">video</a> from RubyOnRailsVideos about TDD. This one talked about writing pending specs before you get properly started to give you some...</p>

        I started the next <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/prime-factors/">kata</a> at Coders Dojo. I think you're supposed to do katas over and over again, but I didn't think I'd gain that much from repeating the FizzBuzz kata from yesterday. Maybe when I've got a better hang of things I can go back to FizzBuzz and learn something from it. Anyways, today's exercise was new to me - finding all the prime factors for a given number. Of course I've done this in math class, but I haven't written a program for it before.

        Back in December Elle suggested running a continuation event for Rails Girls, something for the girls who had completed <a href="http://www.railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> and were looking for something else to push their Ruby/Rails education a bit further. I thought this was a great idea and wanted to be part of it. Elle suggested I organise it and make it happen (with a bunch of support from her and RubyConf), and I was really keen for the challenge and having a bigger role in the Ruby community. I'd talked with Elle and others...</p>

        Second day of working with TDD and I actually got to write some <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-2">code!</a> I tried to work with <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/">Coders Dojo,</a> but their web interface only seems to allow Unit Test (we use RSpec at work, so that's what I'd like to start with), and I couldn't correct yesterday's command line tool/xcode issue (hopefully I'll be able to download xcode properly when I get to work on Monday). Anyways, I used their site to get some ideas of what to work on and decided on the classic FizzBuzz. An...</p>

        I've been feeling for a while now that I'd like to be a better programmer. Right now I can make stuff happen, but I usually don't think it's particularly well designed. Since it's a new year, full of possibilities, I thought I'd spend some time working on my programming skills. With that in mind I asked my boss what he thought I needed to work on most. His answer: TDD. So here I am, trying to do 30 days of thoughtful practice of TDD.
