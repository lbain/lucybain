        I use Sublime. I know, I know, I'm not a <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">"real"</a> dev. Whatever. It works for me. One of my favourite features is the multi-cursor. If you're a fellow Sublime user and aren't aware of this ability you should really check it out. Look at <a href="http://blog.generalassemb.ly/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/">step 12</a> for a little gif of what it looks like.

        This is an awesome tool for making bulk edits in a file. <code>cmd + mouse-click</code> is where I started, but then <a href="https://twitter.com/gerwinvanroyen">@gerwinvanroyen</a> told me about selecting a bunch of lines and then doing <code>cmd + shift + L</code> to select all the...</p>

        I stumbled across this validation gotcha a while back, but that was before I had this awesome blog ;) I think this is a pretty big one, hope this help someone!

        <code>::ActiveModel::Validations</code> treats <code>validates</code> and <code>validate</code> differently. <code>validates</code> is used for normal validations <code>presence</code>, <code>length</code>, and the like. <code>validate</code> is used for custom validation methods <code>validate_name_starts_with_a</code>, or whatever crazy method you come up with. These methods are clearly useful and help keep data clean.

        I said at the beginning that I wasn't a huge fan of TDD. It just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Today I took some time to explore that, and it turns out, I'm not the only one. Most people have mixed reviews, and that's exactly what I'm experiencing now.

          <a href="http://www.writemoretests.com/2011/09/test-driven-development-give-me-break.html">Test-Driven Development? Give me a breakâ€¦</a> said that <b>requiring</b> TDD was a bad idea, but that the general principal is probably good. It's possible to have too much of a good thing.

        I'm continuing on at Coders Dojo, today I worked on <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/roman-numerals/">Roman Numerals</a>. I've heard this problem talked about, but haven't actually worked on it myself. It was harder than I expected (and involved a lot of Googling for the correct way to convert numbers to roman numerals), but I did <a href="https://github.com/lbain/tdd-practice/tree/master/day-4">finish</a> it with all green specs.

        I also watch the next <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyBybIZJpyA&amp;amp;list=PLVBFw0Pn9e9IduDzgOx7Yoh0ur7SZa7hu&amp;amp;index=3">video</a> from RubyOnRailsVideos about TDD. This one talked about writing pending specs before you get properly started to give you some...</p>

        I started the next <a href="http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/prime-factors/">kata</a> at Coders Dojo. I think you're supposed to do katas over and over again, but I didn't think I'd gain that much from repeating the FizzBuzz kata from yesterday. Maybe when I've got a better hang of things I can go back to FizzBuzz and learn something from it. Anyways, today's exercise was new to me - finding all the prime factors for a given number. Of course I've done this in math class, but I haven't written a program for it before.
