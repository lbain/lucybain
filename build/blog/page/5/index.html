            I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!

Although I love what <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/">InstallFest</a> do, I think attendees find it quite hard to continue learning.

            I use Sublime. I know, I know, I'm not a <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">"real"</a> dev. Whatever. It works for me. One of my favourite features is the multi-cursor.
