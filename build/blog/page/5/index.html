            I’m continuing my JS learning and found a list of <a href="https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">front end interview questions</a>. There’s a section devoted to JS on there for me to work through. If they're important enough to know in an interview I should probably know about them too.

            My coworker users vim, and has a snazzy macro to put a <code>binding.pry</code> wherever he using a keyboad shortcut. I thought it was a neat trick (and he mentioned something about Sublime not being a real editor), so I decided to implement it for Sublime as...</p>

            It’s been almost 3 weeks since RubyConf. Feels like longer. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2014/RubyConfAU/">quick review</a> after the event, but that post didn’t do RubyConf justice.

            I recently discovered how to get Sublime to fix indentations for you! Since I spend a certain amount of time each day pushing characters left and right this was pretty exciting. Hope you find it useful!

            I just finished RubyConf Australia, and what a wild ride! I've never been to a conference before, and I was a bit nervous what it would be like. Would people be welcoming? Would I know where to be? Would everyone be taking notes, or no one? Turns...</p>

Although I love what <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/">InstallFest</a> do, I think attendees find it quite hard to continue learning.
