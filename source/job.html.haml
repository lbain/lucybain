%h1 Job
%p I work for #{link_to 'BetterBills', 'http://www.betterbills.com/'} as a (primarily) backend dev in Ruby on Rails. We're a fairly small team, 5 devs when I wrote this, which means I get to work on a lot of cool parts of our code. We have regular code reviews, and I learn a TON from my coworkers. We're a good team, and we're always looking for more devs to join us. So #{link_to 'check us out', 'http://www.splitit.com.au/jobs/'} if you're looking for a new place to work! #{link_to 'Let me know', 'https://twitter.com/lucykbain'} if I can answer any questions or if you're planning on applying. Hope to see you soon!
