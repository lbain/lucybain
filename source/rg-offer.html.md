# Heya!

If you don't know me, I'm Lucy Bain, and I've helped with every Rails Girls event run in Sydney. I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and have been for almost 3 years. I enjoy tutoring and mentoring, and I'm particularly interested in how to get better at it. To that end...

I'd like your help! I want to give focused, one-on-one tutoring to three women and walk them through the Rails Girls tutorial. You'll learn about Rails and get your questions answered. I'll learn what questions people have and better way to word the instructions and explanations. It's a win-win!

**Details:**

* We'll meet at my office in Sydney's CBD (I'll email you the exact address) sometime this weekend (Dec 6 or 7). Time slots are: 12-3pm on Saturday, 4-7pm on Saturday, and 12-3pm on Sunday (semi-flexible, see below)
* We'll go through the [Rails Girls basic tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/) (and possibly one more)
* The meeting will last for up to 3 hours, but if we end early, that's cool too
* I'll record our conversation, and possibly the screen if my computer doesn't overheat (not likely). These recordings will only be heard/seen by me and will NOT be publicly available.
* You must have Rails installed and/or be on a Mac computer (it might take 3 hours just to get Rails installed on a windows machine...)

**Interested?**

If you'd like to meet with me, please [contact me](/contact-me). In your message please mention your past experience with programming and Rails (if any, I'd like to work with at least one absolute beginner!). Also mention which time slot you'd most prefer, or if you can't make any of those slots please suggest another (but it means I'm less likely to be able to work with you, which would be sad!).

**Note:**
Sorry men! This is focused on Rails Girls, which is largely for women.
