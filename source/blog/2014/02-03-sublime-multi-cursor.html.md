title: Sublime Multi-Cursor
---
I use Sublime. I know, I know, I’m not a [“real”](http://xkcd.com/378/) dev. Whatever. It works for me. One of my favourite features is the multi-cursor. If you're a fellow Sublime user and aren’t aware of this ability you should really check it out. Look at [step 12](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) for a little gif of what it looks like.

This is an awesome tool for making bulk edits in a file. `cmd + mouse-click` is where I started, but then [@gerwinvanroyen](https://twitter.com/gerwinvanroyen) told me about selecting a bunch of lines and then doing `cmd + shift + L` to select all the lines individually. Also running a `find all` in Sublime and then using the multiple cursors from there has been really helpful.

So go try it out - it’s pretty powerful!
