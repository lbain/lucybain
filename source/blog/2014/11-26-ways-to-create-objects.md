## What are a few different ways to create new objects?

Well it turns out this topic has been covered quite a lot (unlike my last post about host vs. native objects). I donâ€™t really have anything to add to the conversation, so I'll just give you the two links that I found the most helpful on this topic.

__Resources__

* [phpied](http://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/) - an attractive explanation. I found this easiest to read.
* [A Developer Life](http://a-developer-life.blogspot.com.au/2011/11/7-ways-to-create-objects-in-javascript.html) - an exhaustive list of ways to create objects, complete with examples. This was more in depth.

I hope you find those sites as useful as I did!
