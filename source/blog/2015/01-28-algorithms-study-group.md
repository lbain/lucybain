Last year I ran two study groups, one for [JS](http://codesydney.com/2014-js) and one for [intro to programming](/python). I also gave a talk about [starting a study group](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18lYj02Tc0dBbAAngrYBGPRSbADnswkjnyAdoeD--WQ4/edit?usp=sharing) at Girl Geek Dinner. I was thrilled when my friend [Daphne](http://daphnechong.com/) decided to organise a [group](http://codesydney.com/2015-algorithms/) on her own to study algorithms.

The course we're going through is Princeton’s intro to algorithms, and it is *hard!* It started a few days ago, and just getting through the lectures took quite some time. But it’s really interesting. I'm keeping my [notes online](http://1drv.ms/1tdZuA6) so I can share them with anyone interested. This blog post doesn’t have a lot of content, but I promise the link to my notes does. The course has been keeping me pretty busy, so I figured I should get at least one blog post up about it!

Many thanks to Daphne, and here’s to more learning in 2015!
