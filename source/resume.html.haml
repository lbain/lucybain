    -# Team lead
    %p
      I enjoy working with others to produce a better outcome. Facilitating discussions, coordinating different streams of work, and making sure our features meet quality standards means the team can ship better features faster.
      I want to connect people with stretch projects so they can learn more and progress their career. Finally, I strive to give frequent, timely feedback so team members can adjust quickly and continue to improve.

    -# Front end
      %p
        I love learning a concept and understanding how it fits together in the larger picture. To gain a better view of the full stack I'm moving away from back end development and focusing on front end challenges. I'm interested in writing what the user interacts with and making sure they have an wonderful experience. I'm looking for a company focused on quality and a position where I can explore new problems and come up with creative solutions.

    -# Teaching
      %p
        I am driven to help people who help themselves. I love learning, and especially enjoy learning with others for encouragement and different perspectives. At work I'm an advocate for pair programming to share knowledge around the team. Outside of work I volunteer in the community, and run my own study groups so I can learn alongside other motivated programmers. I want to take this passion for education and community further and reach a wider audience. I'm looking for a role where I can encourage learners to explore new ideas and challenge them to do their best work.
